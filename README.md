# Animal-Fighter--real-  
Welcome to Farmhouse Frenzy!
This farm comes alive when the Farmer Joe goes to bed. Once the sun goes down these farm animals start brawling.  


The beautiful prairies and phenomenal mountain views are all one needs to fall in love with the amazing state of Montana. 
Farmer Joe, a simple, hard working farmer, lives a peaceful life somewhere in the countryside of this majestic state. 
The farm has an abundance of healthy, lively farm animals that live together while entertaining one another. 
This picture perfect farm life is everything anyone could ever ask for; however, what lies behind the barn doors
is a secret the world, and Farmer Joe, will never discover - a farmhouse fight club. 
This fight club was born out of boredom and tension between the farm animals, now the animals can battle out
their problems while the others can witness and place bets on who will win. Who’s up next in this Farmhouse Frenzy arena?
Let’s welcome to the stage… The Cheeky Chicken! The Cheeky Chicken is a small but mighty force to be reckoned with,
he has a dangerous peck and a cannon for an arm that throws eggs as a long range attack during his battles. 
And for his opponent, let’s welcome to the stage… The Crazy Cow! The Crazy Cow is a complete and utter powerhouse with
its body slam and its forceful milk that shoots from his utters and knocks his enemy down. These two got into a super heated 
argument, and of course, this is the only way to settle the dispute. 
Each player will play as one of the characters that are fighting in the arena, throughout the game there will be powerups
that give their players a more powerful attack and cause more damage to their opponent. The game will last until one of the
players lands enough attacks on the other player so that their health goes down to zero. Each player's health will be represented
by a health bar at the top of the screen on the side of where each player is playing and where each character started the game. 
The key challenges presented in this game vary because it depends on how skilled your opponent is, so the built in challenges
in the game are minimal. The arena will consist of a few levels that the players can move around and chase one another. 
There will be the main level on the ground, and a few more levels of the barn that the players can run across and jump on.
The other levels will be parts of wood from the barn or shelves, some stacked hay, and light fixtures. This will allow the players to have a larger battlefield to fight in. 
This game is geared towards any age and any audience that enjoys competing against other players. 
The game can be higher level and faster paced or lower level and slower paced, it just depends on the two players that decide to play against each other.
As mentioned earlier, there are not many built in challenges in the game; therefore, the challenges are mainly dependent upon the players that are interacting with the game.
